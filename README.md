# Predicting Factors of Teen Vape Use
The purpose of our project is to analyzes the factors contributing to teen vape use. Using data from the 2014-2018 New York Youth Tobacco Surveys, a classification tree was trained with eight factors to predict teen vape behavior and determine which contributed most to vaping. Based on the analysis, the biggest contributing factors were having lived with a smoker, whether the student is in high school or middle school, and allowance money. Validation of the model yielded an accuracy of 74.13%.
